#Backstage
## 
###An Immersive Listening Experience

Problem: Existing services like Soundcloud are excellent at music discovery, but many of its social features create a noisy, obtrusive experience.

Backstage is my simple solution. It's simply your music, and you.


1. Soundcloud Authentication
2. Ability to Like to Soundcloud
3. Fullscreen Music Player


### What's Next?

1. Polish Soundcloud Authentication. 

	So far, it adds to your cache that you're logged into Soundcloud, so later when you have to connect again to Like songs it's not that difficult. But I'd like to streamline that process by having OAuth create a token that stores the User's data *on our server* so signing up and logging in for all the features is one click.

2. Customize the music player's content to either respond to playlists or a person's feed.

	In these early stages, the music player's content is an artist's feed.


3. More features that simulate a live show.

4. More dynamic backgrounds.
5. Smooth out onboarding process.
